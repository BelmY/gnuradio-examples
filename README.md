What's all this?
================

Random gnuradio things, so they don't stay trapped on my laptop forever

Doppler Sonar
-------------

A simple continuous wave doppler system using your computer's built-in speaker and microphone.

Eventually this could serve as the basis for learning more about modulated radars

RF Loopback
-----------

Transmit tone from HackRF, receive on RTL-SDR. Just to make sure the TX and RX path works

XMLRPC Control
--------------

A simple demonstration of adding an XMLRPC endpoint to a flowgraph

Persistent Configuration
------------------------

This demonstrates how to save runtime variables and reload them at flowgraph start
